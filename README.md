# PaperTorch

Reimplementing ML papers in PyTorch:
- [x] ~~AlexNet [[link to paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks)]~~
- [ ] ZFNet [[link to paper]()]
- [ ] VGG16 [[link to paper]()]
- [ ] ResNet [[link to paper]()]
- [ ] GoogLeNet [[link to paper]()]
- [ ] Inception [[link to paper]()]
- [ ] Xception [[link to paper]()]
- [ ] MobileNet [[link to paper]()]

More will be added as I go. This current list is all based on NN architecture.
